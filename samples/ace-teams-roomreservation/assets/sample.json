      "The Executive Room Reservation application is an executive scheduling application that allows users to see upcoming meetings, select and book a room based on availability dates and the number of participants. Users can see a photo of the room where the meeting is booked, get an address to the building to put in the meeting invite, and get directions to the building. It provides a seamless way for executive assistants to schedule meeting rooms for executive meetings. The application demonstrates the ability to create a visually engaging Microsoft Teams based solution."
